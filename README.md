## Overview

This project is a template for setting up a basic C++ project using OpenCV. It uses CMake for building, vcpkg for package management.

## Windows Requirements

- **CMake**: Version 3.12 or higher ([Install Link](https://cmake.org/download/))
- **Ninja**: On Windows, it is included with Visual Studio 2022
- **vcpkg**: Have it available using `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable ([Tutorial for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-powershell))
- Any C++ compiler with C++20 support (Visual Studio Installer -> Modify -> Desktop Development witg C++)

## MAC Requirements
